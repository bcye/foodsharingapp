# Foodsharing App
I want to create a food sharing app with a very simple UI, so the experience is as fast as possible. The idea behind it is to:

* to have an very easy way to share food at any time anywhere
* it’s also an exercise project for me

## Mobile
I want to create at least the **iOS** app in the **native** swift lang, as I haven’t yet worked with cross-platform languages/frameworks and I want to exercise Swift.
As for **other platforms**, I haven’t got any experience with them and I’m searching for contributors to port this project/build this project for other platforms.
I haven’t planned a website version for it.

##  Database
For the backend part I want just to use Firebase as a database.

## Design
I already have a pretty straight idea of the UI design and am creating a mockup to share it.
Just download Adobe XD (it's free) and open the [.xd file from the design folder](design/appMockup.xd)

## Contribute
This project **hasn’t started really yet**, so just join the [gitter room](https://gitter.im/foodsharingapp/Lobby) and discuss what can be done.
